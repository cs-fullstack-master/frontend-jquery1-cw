# Introduction to jQuery Graded Classwork

## Use only jQuery to select elements 
  
### Exercise 1: 
Create a new HTML file and paste the text below into the body of the HTML file. Use jQuery and CSS to give the elements in the provided HTML their desired features. 

```
    <div class='redText'>I should be red!</div>
    <div class='redText'>I should be red too!</div>
    <div id="myElement">I should be blue! When you click on me I want you to invoke a function 
    that uses alert() to display the message "myElement was clicked!"
        <div>I want my background to be green and my text white!</div>
        <div>I want my background to be orange and my text pink!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='redText'>Red please!</div>
```

### Exercise 2:
Using the existing ```selectors.html``` file, write the JavaScript or jQuery needed to hide and display the middle image every 2 seconds (Hint: Interval).


### Exercise 3: 
Create a table with 4 columns and 6 rows. Put the text "jQuery" in each cell/box. Add a button outside of that table. When that button is clicked set the background color of every other row to grey.
